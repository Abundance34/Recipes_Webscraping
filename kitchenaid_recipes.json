        "steps": [
            "STEP 1: START WHISKING HEAVY CREAM Affix the wire whisk accessory to a KitchenAid®stand mixer. Add heavy cream to the mixing bowl. Attach the pouring shield. Start the mixer on the slowest setting, gradually raising the speed to the fastest setting. Keep a dish towel on hand to cover the pouring spout if the cream splashes out.",
            "STEP 2: WATCH FOR THE CREAM TO SEPARATE The cream will go through three stages: soft peaks, then stiff peaks and finally the butter solids will separate from the buttermilk. Once you see the butter solids separate, stop the stand mixer and pour out the buttermilk. (The buttermilk can be reserved for other uses.)",
            "STEP 3: PRESS THE BUTTER Transfer the butter to a fine mesh sieve set over a large bowl. Using a spatula, press the butter into the sieve to remove any excess buttermilk. (The less buttermilk that remains in the butter, the longer the butter may last.)",
            "STEP 4: RINSE THE BUTTER Clean the KitchenAid®stand mixer bowl, then return the butter to it. Add 1/4 cup of ice-cold water to the bowl then whip the butter again for around 10 seconds to “wash” the butter and get rid of any excess buttermilk. Once the water becomes cloudy pour it out and repeat the process until the water remains clear.",
            "STEP 5: ADD FLAVOR IF DESIRED Pour out any water remaining in the bowl. Replace the whisk accessory with the flat beater. Add any ingredients you want to flavor the butter to the bowl and beat until they are just combined. Finished butter can be formed into a log and wrapped in cellophane or parchment paper. Refrigerate it for immediate use."

        "ingredients": "No ingredients found",
        "steps": [
            "STEP 1: PREP THE INGREDIENTS Before making your cinnamon roll bread, gather your equipment and ingredients for all three parts of the recipe: Dough, filling and icing. If using the KitchenAid®Bread Bowl accessory, fill it with hot water, empty and pat dry. This will help create a warm environment to encourage the yeast to bloom.",
            "STEP 2: ACTIVATE THE YEAST Add your liquid (either water or milk), sugar and yeast and give it a quick whisk to combine. Let it sit for several minutes to allow the yeast to bloom.",
            "STEP 3: ADD INGREDIENTS AND KNEAD Add the rest of the dry ingredients to your mixing bowl or stand mixer bowl and begin to combine. When the dough begins to form, take it out of the bowl and knead it on a lightly floured surface. This may take anywhere from 7–9 minutes, but the ideal time to stop kneading ultimately depends on when the dough begins to appear smooth and elastic.",
            "STEP 4: PROOF THE BREAD DOUGH Transfer the dough to a proofing container and cover. If using the Bread Bowl accessory, you can proof your dough in the bowl, using the included baking lid to cover it. It’s best to keep your dough in a warm place while it rises. Check your recipe, but proofing should only take about 30 minutes for this type of dough.",
            "STEP 5: PREPARE THE CINNAMON FILLING While your dough is proofing, mix up the sugar and cinnamon along with any other dry ingredients for your filling and soften the butter if needed. Keep thebutterseparate.",
            "STEP 6: ADD THE CINNAMON FILLING Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface until it’s around a quarter inch thick. Spread your softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle with your filling mixture.",
            "STEP 7: ROLL UP THE DOUGH This step depends on what kind of bakeware you are using. If using a loaf pan, you may roll individual cinnamon rolls and then stack them throughout the pan. If using the Bread Bowl accessory or other flat bakeware, you can roll the dough into one large cinnamon roll. Do this by cutting into about four strips, then rolling each into the next for a continuous roll.",
            "STEP 8: PROOF THE BREAD AGAIN If using a loaf pan, set your rolls a few inches apart and cover with a cloth. If you have one large roll, place it on your bakeware and cover. Let the dough rise for another 30 minutes before baking. Now is a good time to preheat your oven per your recipe settings.",
            "STEP 9: BAKE THE CINNAMON ROLL BREAD Place your bakeware on a center rack and bake according to your recipe instructions. If following the Yummly recipe, you will drizzle the roll with heavy cream about halfway through. Prepare your glaze while your bread bakes and your home fills with tempting aromas.",
            "STEP 10: ADD THE GLAZE Let your cinnamon roll bread cool for around 10 minutes, then get to glazing. Depending on the consistency of your glaze or icing, you may drizzle or spread with a pastry spatula. This easycream cheese frosting recipeis fluffy and decadent."

        "steps": [
            "Step 1: Cube Butter Remove the butter from your refrigerator and cut into 1 inch cubes. When you’ve finished, place the butter cubes back into the refrigerator to keep them chilled. Now is a great time to start preheating your oven since the dough will come together quickly. Most biscuits will bake at around 425°F but check your recipe as ingredients will affect the bake time and temperature.",
            "Step 2: Add Dry Ingredients Add the flour and other dry ingredients to your KitchenAid®stand mixer fitted with the Pastry Beater. Set to Stir briefly to mix your dry ingredients evenly.",
            "STEP 3: MEASURE OUT LIQUIDS Measure your liquids out and set aside so they’re on-hand when you need them. If making your own “buttermilk” alternative, add vinegar to milk and give it a quick stir.",
            "STEP 4: ADD COLD BUTTER With the mixer still running, add cold butter cubes to the mixer bowl and let it cut in the butter for around one minute or until the mixture has formed pea-sized chunks of butter coated in flour.",
            "Step 5: Add Liquids Increase to speed 2 and slowly add in your liquids in 2 second increments, then turn off the mixer to avoid overworking the dough.",
            "Step 6: Gather the Dough Gather the dough in your hands to form a loose ball–the dough should be sticky and shaggy. On a lightly floured surface, gently knead the dough a few times using a folding technique that will help create layers within the dough. Then press the dough out into a thick layer for cutting. See the fulleasy biscuit recipefor detailed instructions on kneading. Or learn 3 differentways to knead dough.",
            "Step 7: Cut out Biscuits Using a biscuit cutter or other tool, cut out your desired size and number of biscuits, then place on a baking sheet. Bake per your recipe instructions, usually about 20 minutes. You can brush the tops with melted butter before baking for an extra golden finish."

        "steps": [
            "Step 1: Prep the pans Preheat the oven per your recipe, usually 350°F. To help remove the cakes once baked, you can spray two round pans with baking spray and line bottoms with parchment paper. Then, spray the paper and dust with flour. If you’re cooking a sheet cake, you can skip the parchment paper step.",
            "Step 2: Combine DRY ingredients In a large bowl, stir dry ingredients such as cake flour, sugar, baking powder and salt until combined. This helps ensure dry ingredients will be evenly distributed throughout your batter when you mix them in later.",
            "Step 3: CREAM THE BUTTER In a bowl of a KitchenAid®stand mixer with a flat beater or flex edge beater accessory, beat the butter and sugar until it has a pale yellow color and light, fluffy texture. This step helps aerate the butter and is crucial for that classic spongy cake texture. Finally, add egg whites and beat until combined.",
            "Step 4: ADD REMAINING INGREDIENTS Add a third of the dry ingredients and mix until combined. Then add a third of the milk and vanilla or melted chocolate and continue to mix. Repeat three times until all the ingredients are gone. Your batter should be smooth and slightly fluffy.",
            "Step 5: Bake layers Divide batter between prepared cake pans. Bake on the center rack until a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. It’s important to either bake your pans on the same rack, or rotate halfway through to help ensure both cakes bake at similar rates. Briefly cool cakes in the pans, then carefully invert cakes and transfer, flat-side down, to a cooling rack to cool completely.",
            "Step 6: Make frosting In a clean bowl of a KitchenAid®stand mixer with the flat beater accessory, beat the butter until it’s soft, light and fluffy. Add powdered sugar in increments, beating on high speed after each addition until just combined. This will help the sugar fully dissolve in your mixture. Add milk and salt last and stir until combined.",
            "Step 7: Combine cake Use a serrated knife to trim the domed tops of fully cooled cakes to create a flat surface. If you try to frost a warm cake, the frosting will slide off so patience is key. Place one cake, cut-side up, on a cake stand or serving plate. Use an offset spatula to frost the top of the cake. Top with second cake, cut-side down. Frost sides and top of cakes. Decorate with sprinkles, fresh fruit, coconut or whatever you can dream up."

            "Step 1: Cube Butter Remove the butter from your refrigerator and cut into 1 inch cubes. When you’ve finished, place the butter cubes back into the refrigerator to keep them chilled.",
            "Step 2: Add Dry Pie Crust Ingredients Add flour, sugar and salt into the work bowl of your stand mixer and turn to ”Stir for about 10 seconds. This step helps evenly distribute your dry ingredients for a consistent base.",
            "STEP 3: ADD COLD BUTTER With the mixer still running, add cold butter cubes to the mixer bowl. Increase the speed to 2 for around one minute or until the mixture has formed pea-sized chunks of butter coated in flour.",
            "Step 4: Add Ice Water Lower the stand mixer speed to Stir. Then, slowly drizzle in ice water a little at a time in two second increments. Keep a close eye on your mixture and stop adding water when the mixture begins to stick to the beater and there are streaks of flour around the bowl.",
            "Step 5: Gather the Dough Once mixed, gather the dough in your hands. You should be able to shape the dough into a ball and then flatten into a smooth disc. If the dough crumbles in your hands, you may need to add a bit more water. If making a multi-crust batch, divide the dough as needed before forming into separate discs.",
            "Step 6: Wrap and Chill the Pie Dough Securely wrap the disc(s) in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill for a minimum of an hour. While the dough rests, make sure to fully prepare your pie fillings and then set aside or refrigerate if needed. Preheat your oven to 400°F, or according to your recipe instructions. It’s a good idea to have the oven ready soon after you remove your dough from the fridge. This will prevent the butter in the dough from warming while waiting for its turn in the oven.",
            "Step 7: Roll Out Your Pie Crust Dough Lightly flour your countertop or a rolling mat. Remove the pie crust dough one disc at a time from the refrigerator and take off the plastic wrap. Place the disc in the center of the floured surface and roll into a circle about ¼” - ⅛” thick.",
            "Step 8: Place Dough in Baking Dish You will typically grease your pie pan before adding the dough, but check your recipe first. Drape the rolled crust over your pie plate and fit inside, lightly pressing it into the bottom and sides of the pan and trim as needed. If you are making a double crust, leave about 1” of dough hanging over the side of the dish. If not, leave about a half inch and press or crimp per your preference. You can place the entire dish back in the refrigerator while you roll out the top crust (if using).",
            "Step 9: Add Pie Fillings and Top Crust Pour your fillings into the pie crust and top or finish off according to your recipe. If making a double crust, drape it over your fillings and trim to match the bottom crust, or slightly overhang it. Press the two crusts together using the tines of a fork, your fingers, or according to your recipe. You can also create a beautifullattice pieby cutting the dough into strips and weaving them on top. Bake according to your recipe instructions."

            "Step 1. Knead dough and let rest In the bowl of your KitchenAid®stand mixer, mix the flour and salt together and create a hole in the center of the mound of flour to form a well. Place the eggs and the oil or water (if using) in the middle of the hole and continue to mix. Gradually incorporate the flour using your stand mixer, until all the ingredients are mixed together, forming a single mass that's wet and sticky.",
            "Step 2. Prepare filling Place the cheese, egg, herbs, and other ingredients in your stand mixer mixing bowl. Mix all the ingredients together until it comes together to form the texture of a paste. Set aside.",
            "Step 3. Make the tomato sauce Start by heating up olive oil before adding in seasonings and ingredients such as chopped garlic and oregano. Next, add in herbs such as fresh chopped parsley and basil. For some added depth of flavor, you can also add balsamic vinegar. Next, add in tomatoes and salt. Stir everything together and use either a fork or a potato masher to break down the tomatoes further. Let the sauce simmer, stirring occasionally. Turn off heat and check salt and seasoning and adjust to taste.",
            "Step 4. Roll out the pasta dough Once you're ready to make the ravioli, remove the dough from the refrigerator and place onto a floured surface. To keep your dough from drying out, work in quarters and keep the rest covered under a towel or wrapped in plastic. Use theKitchenAid®Pasta Roller Attachmentto make thin sheets of pasta that are no thicker than a nickel. Carefully place the pasta sheets onto parchment-lined baking trays.",
            "Step 5: Add filling and seal ravioli If you're working by hand, place a tablespoon of the four cheese blend onto the bottom half of the pasta dough, about an inch apart from each other. You can either brush an egg wash or some water on the edges of the dough and fold the top half of the sheet over the filling.",
            "Step 6: Cook the ravioli and serve Bring a pot of salted water to a  boil and cook the ravioli for around three minutes, or until tender. Serve with the tomato sauce (or any sauce of your choice) and enjoy!"

            "STEP 1: PREP THE INGREDIENTS Beforemaking your bread, gather your equipment and ingredients. Fill the KitchenAid®Bread Bowl accessory with hot water, then empty it and pat dry. This will help create a warm environment to encourage the yeast to bloom.",
            "STEP 2: ADD INGREDIENTS AND KNEAD Add all ingredients except the cherries and chocolate to your stand mixer and attach the Dough Hook accessory. Set your stand mixer to speed 2 and let the mixer do the work for you. After 30 seconds, add dried cherries and chocolate and continue toknead. When the dough begins to slap the side of the bowl, it’s ready for the next step.",
            "STEP 3: PROOF THE RYE BREAD DOUGH Remove the Bread Bowl accessory from the stand mixer and cover it with the Baking Lid. It’s best to keep your dough in a warm place while it rises. Proofing should take around 1 ½ -2 hours for this type of dough.",
            "STEP 4: KNEAD AND FORM THE DOUGH Gentlyknead the doughon a floured surface and shape into a round mound. Place the mound back into the Bread Bowl and cover it with the lid. Proof it again for another 30 minutes before baking. Now is a good time to preheat your oven per the recipe settings.",
            "STEP 5: BAKE THE BREAD Turn the bowl over with the loaf on Baking Lid and bake according to your recipe instructions."

            "STEP 2: STEP 2: HEAT BUTTER AND MILK You can use softened butter, butmelted buttercombined with milk on the stovetop will ensure it evenly incorporates into your dough while keeping the whole mixture warm. You can also dissolve the sugar and salt into your liquids at this point. Sugar helps feed the yeast and can lend a tender texture to your bread.",
            "STEP 3: COMBINE AND MIX ALL INGREDIENTS Next, just add all ingredients to your stand mixer bowl while set to speed 2 and mix until a shaggy dough forms.",
            "Step 4: Knead Sandwich Bread Dough Swap out the flat beater for your dough hook and knead on speed 2 for 5-7 minutes or until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl. Add a bit more flour if needed until the dough is elastic and smooth.",
            "Step 5: Shape Dough and Proof Using your hands, gently shape the dough into a ball. Use a light-tasting oil to lightly grease the mixer bowl, then put the dough ball back inside, turning to coat with oil. Cover the mixer bowl and put in a warm, breeze-free area to proof.",
            "Step 6: Rest the dough After the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and then portion as needed to fit your pans, shaping each segment into a ball again. Let the dough rest on a floured surface for around 10 minutes.",
            "Step 7: Shape and Place in Pans Shape the dough to fit your pans and place inside, then cover with a towel and proof again until the dough begins to rise above the top edge of the pan. Now is a good time to begin preheating your oven per recipe instructions.",
            "Step 8: Bake Sandwich Bread Bake the bread per your recipe. It’s best to bake bread on the center oven rack. Once finished, remove your homemade sandwich bread from the loaf pans and allow to cool completely on a cooling rack."

With the mixer set on speed 4 place very cold meat(s) in the grinder attachment a piece at a time. Alternate meat with pieces of toasted bread, chopped onion, garlic and parsley.",
            "STEP 2: PREPARE THE MEATBALLS When the ingredients are ground, remove the food grinder attachment and replace with the flat beater attachment. Add milk, egg and any other seasonings to the ground meat mixture in the bowl of the stand mixer. Mix on low for 1-2 minutes until the ingredients are well combined. Scoop the meatballs onto a cookie sheet with a small ice cream scoop, or form balls with damp fingers (meatballs should be about the size of a golf ball).",
            "STEP 3: COOK THE MEATBALLS You can bake the meatballs in the oven at this point, but to get a nice brown sear, heat butter and oil in a saute pan and brown meatballs until cooked through and a crust forms (searing is also a great way tocook steaks on the stove). Make sure not to overcrowd the pan – cook in batches – so meatballs brown and don’t steam. Remove cooked meatballs from the pan and cover with foil while you prepare the sauce.",
            "STEP 4: PREPARE THE SAUCE Add flour and butter to the pan drippings and stir until brown. Add stock and cream to the butter and flour and whisk together. Finish with a little mustard and worcestershire sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Add the meatballs back to the sauce and warm for a minute or two. Serve with egg noodles, rice or side of your choice."

Watch for soft peaks forming in the whipped cream to know when it is finished (about 6–7 minutes).",

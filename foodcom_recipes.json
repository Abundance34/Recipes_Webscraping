My wife has fixed ribs before, but usually used the boil and grill method. Seeing this one explained so clearly, and seemingly so easy, I thought I'd try it. I had two slabs of ribs and baked them at 225 for five hours (I had to run up and pick up something so they were in an hour over what it said).  Even after 5 hours, the ribs were juicy, tender, and falling apart. I think having it covered gives it a lot of leeway in the cooking department, along with the low temp. Adding the sauce and baking it on uncovered for 25 minutes gave me ribs that I can honestly compare with restaurant quality (unless you want grilled of course).  We make our own BBQ sauce as we like it spicy, so all I can say is EASY, FOOLPROOF, and DELICIOUS!!",

I wanted to find a good recipe that my sister could have -- she has Celiac disease and can't have gluten, so readily available bottled sauce isn't something we can use.  This was just wonderful.  Before I added the slurry I had her taste the sauce and she said it tasted just like what she remembered from the restaurants.  Five stars and two thumbs up!<br\/><br\/>A quick tip to those who said their sauce was too watery: a slurry (any type of starch mixed with water) needs to be made with cold to cool -- NEVER HOT -- water and added to SIMMERING liquid.  It's okay to bring your liquid to a boil, but you need to lower it again until it's gently boiling with LITTLE waves.  You can't just add cornstarch (or any starch) into a hot liquid, it won't bind it, and the liquid can't be too hot or it breaks the starch down and, again, it does nothing.",

After leaving Ohio I had to order by the case ($100 ) online to keep my supply steady and my hands from shaking from withdrawl.  I've tried many different fake recipes and none come close to the real deal.  This recipe is BY FAR the best I've tried.  I would still like to think in a double blind taste test I could pick out the original but it might be close.  I did take in some of the other reviewer suggestions and agree they are necessary.  First the meat needs to boil in the broth.  I put the raw 85% lean meat, water with beef bullion, and onions (I only used 1 cup finely chopped) in a pot to cook stovetop.  I used a mashed potato masher to break up the meat.  My end result meat was still a little coarse compared to the original so next time i will use a blender or food processor to break it up finer.  I went with 3T chili powder which did give it a little kick, 2.5T might be closer to the original but I like the heat.  I added a bit of paprika as well.  With 85% lean meat there is no need to skim any fat, it is just about right.  After 1 hour I couldn't wait and ate some.  It was good.  Plan ahead and simmer for 2 hours if possible, its even better.  After 2 hours too much liquid was gone so I would consider covering the pot after 45min or so.  Also for rookies or non Ohioans out there it is essential you get \"fancy shredded mild cheddar cheese\".  Regular shredded cheese (as shown in the picture) is too coarse and will ruin the dish.  When plating a 3-way first put down a bed of spaghetti (regular spaghetti not thin spaghetti),  spoon on the chili covering all but the edges ensuring plenty of liquid flows down through the spaghetti, then add a generous portion of cheese to cover all chili.  Make sure the chili is not too hot, you only want that small portion of the cheese that is in direct contact with the chili to melt.  The top of the cheese should be cool and unmelted.  When you eat it for God's sake don't stir it up.  Add the optional tobasco then use a knife to cut down through the 3 layers and use a fork to lift it to your mouth like a piece of lasagna.  The cool cheese will hit the roof of your mouth and the spaghetti will sit on your tongue.  When you are finished carry your plate to the sink, make sure your wife is not looking and lick the plate clean like a dog.  To the reviewer who gave it one star complaining its not chili, your right.  Its way better and you just don't understand.  I feel sorry for you because you are missing out on one of the finer things in life.",

The bread was very moist and very delicious. I poured the batter into two cans, one with pecans and one without, as well as muffin tins and both were so good. The batter isn't enough for two cans and a muffin tin of twelve unless you double the batch. My grandpa smelt the bread all the way from outside since we had the doors open and he basically stole all the bread. Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!!",

After making it exactly by the recipe a few times, I modified it slightly (though it was already delicious the way it was :-)  They are light, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside when freshly made.  <br\/><br\/>My modifications were:<br\/><br\/>1)  adding 1 tsp vanilla<br\/>2)  adding 1 Tb malted milk powder<br\/>3)  being more generous with the sugar with a heaping scoop, not a leveled-off cup<br\/><br\/>My kids both love these waffles and the recipe is easy to follow and even turns out well when you goof, LOL.... I mistakenly added twice as much oil with one batch and they were still wonderful!  <br\/><br\/>I make a half recipe of these which still makes 4.5 large waffles on my George Foreman grill\/waffle iron. (And I cook the waffles according to my appliance's instructions, 425 for 7-8 minutes.)  What we don't eat then gets stored in a freezer bag for later.  They do get soft\/chewy after they cool down or are stored in refrigerator, but they are still delicious!  Just microwave for a few seconds and enjoy.  My toddler likes them plain as a snack, they are that sweet and tasty.  And I like that they aren't \"crumby\" for him to eat when not in his high chair.",

I have used regular flour, garbanzo bean flour, and almond flour - all with great results. I have made this recipe many times, and I have to say, you can use cooking spray alone, and it works wonderfully. I have found the non-stick foil to be superior, and it works great for this recipe if you have some on hand. The best thing about this is you can get crunchy wings, seasoned to your preference, and save the calories from frying (if you omit the butter and use cooking spray.) Dry the chicken well before you coat it with flour, and make sure they are fully defrosted if they were previously frozen. Excellent, versatile recipe!",

Big Macs were always my guilty pleasure comfort meal. I probably only had one 3 times a year if that when I had a really stressul day! I made this sauce last night and I put it on top of a veggie burger. I added a slice of american cheese and i even added shredded lettuce and tiny chopped onions like Mcdonalds does. It tasted EXACTLY like a big mac! I followed the exact recipe and I was really impressed! I have tried tons of new vegetarian recipes. Some were good and others were not at all. This new veggie burger big mac recipe will definitely be one recipe that I make again!",

The roast was falling-apart tender and the flavour was outstanding. Made a couple of minor changes: my celery was way past its prime so I just added extra carrots, and I had a bit of a heavy hand with the wine and so used about 1\/2 cup; also used dried thyme instead of fresh. The other different thing I did was to puree the veggies after the roast was done and add that puree into the juices, which I boiled and then thickened into a delicious gravy. Thanks Steve; I'll definitely make this easy recipe again.",

My ex-DH wondered how I make these, so I decided to post it and send him the recipe.  Nothing fancy -- just the real, simple, unabridged version.  UPDATE:  After reading Peg629's review, I have tried it that way, with one slice of toast spread with yellow mustard, and I must say it really, really makes an exceptional BLT!  Such a subtle difference, yet genuinely makes a superior BLT, in my opinion!  (Thank you Peg629 for that awesome suggestion!)",

I followed another reviewers advice and used yellow mustard on one slice. One other tip from me:  After slicing the tomatoes, I laid the slices on a stack of paper towels, sprinkled just a little salt on top.  Allowed them to sit for a few minutes while I worked on the other parts of the sandwich.  Then right before assembly, piled a few other paper towels and a plate on top of the slices and inverted them.  This reduced some of the wetness of the tomato and removed most of the bitter seeds.  They were awesome.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

Upon reading the review and recipe, I used 2.5 pounds of chicken ($5 at grocery) and put in pepper and garlic in the mayo.  And i put it for 20 min 10 on each side and the chicken came out very tender and juicy.",

I used Campbell's low fat, low sodium tomato soup with turkey pepperoni & about 1\/8 tsp oregano & basil. I cut up a low fat slice of mozzarella instead of shredded, which created a great, creamy texture! I also mixed all the ingredients in a saucepan & simmered it as most everyone else did. I had skim evaporated milk to use in the fridge so I used that in place of regular milk; worked great! Thanks so much for sharing!",

This time I added some chopped onion. Next time there will be some chopped jalapeno's and I'm going to use HOT enchilada sauce to spice it up even more. I did add some salt and pepper during step 3. Topped it off with some shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sour cream and chopped cilantro. Yummy. Thanks for posting.",

I followed one reviewer's suggestion and sliced the chicken breasts into strips prior to cooking and then tossed them back into the reduced honey\/balsamic glaze for maximum effect of the tasty glaze.  I made extra glaze so we'd have some to drizzle over the aromatic rice.  Thanks for the inspiration I needed for tonight's dinner!",

I would not have thought of mixing the the waldorf salad;ad basics with stuffing to begin with and add that to using it as a fish topping!! It's slightly sweet, slightly tangy, the apple and celery work very well with the stuffing. The mayo in the stuffing mix is reminiscent of tarter sauce which links to the fish. I used Northern Pike but I think that salt water fish would be even better. I served it with a side of asparagus and mushrooms.  Watch the fish in the micro, mine got a bit more cooked than I would have preferred, not a big problem because now I know to start checking it at 3.5 mins (of course this will vary depending on the thickness of your fish).

He was able to choose any recipe from the areas they studied this year, He chose this one. It was really easy & was fun to do with my son. I see this will be one he will want to make over & over again! Its so easy the kids can really put it together by themselves all they will need you for is to have you cut the food and put it in & take it out of the oven.(unless your kids are old enough to do those things themselves. Only few changes I advise is to make the scrolls 1\/2inch instead of 1inch to get the 24-36 servings. To convert the cooking temp in (F)= 395 degrees. Oh & in the US if you dont know what a capsicum is, its a red peper. (this really was a challenge since I didnt think to look it up before I went shopping and no one in the stores seemed to have any idea what I was requesting-lol. You do need to spray the pan to keep it from sticking. Other then those MINOR things it really was quite a great recipe to make. Enjoy!",

I used provolone cheese (it was what I had on hand) and added a smear of recipe #357420 for some heat. The package of hawaiian rolls I bought was only 12 rolls, not 16; I made 6 tonight and will do the other 6 later in the week. I melted 1 1\/2 Tbsp butter and added 1 Tbsp Worcestershire and thought those amounts were perfect, but I had some mixture left over after brushing the 6 rolls. Baked for 15 minutes and they were quite brown (but not burned) - I think from the Worcestershire. I have a lot of the beef left over and I might just have to get another pkg of rolls because these little sandwiches are so great! Thanks for sharing!",

        "description":"These are simple, delicious and pefect for Super Bowl Sunday or any party! My family and friends always rave about them, sometimes I have to make an extra batch because they go so fast. You don't have to use a rotisserie chicken, but it sure cuts back on the time. If you don't like things too spicy, you can always cut back on the hot sauce and green onions.I like to use peanut oil for frying. They freeze well too. Making the dip ahead of time, then placing in fridge, allows the flavors to marry well. Bring it back to room temp to serve. This is adapted from a Food Network Show, Big Daddy's House. The chef is Aaron McCargo Jr. Hope you enjoy!",

I included them in a tin of cookies for my hubby's co-workers and one of them ate all of them before anyone else could try them. She also demanded the recipe.\r\nFrom the cookbook &quot;Fix, Freeze, Feast&quot; by Katie Neville and Lindsey Tkacsik.\r\nMake them ahead of time, keep in your freezer and bake what you need. I plan to have these on hand all the time.",

I added one shrimp on each and in the oven they went. Excited, the timer went off! As I pulled them from the oven, I reveled in amazement of how beautiful and perfect they all looked. I plated them and couldn't wait to try!! I popped one in my mouth (it's a huge bite, lol) and. ................ Wa wa waaaa, no flavor. So disappointing. I realized then that there is only garlic and scallions in the recipe. I seasoned the tops with a sprinkle of kosher salt and that just made them taste salty. Then I tried old bay on top. Maybe it's better mixed in because that just tasted weird. I think the mozzarella masks the creaminess and deliciousness of the cream cheese. I do love crab rangoons ALOT so I did think that these were going to taste like that but with shrimp so maybe I had the wrong expectations. 2 stars because they looked beautiful. Sorry, I really wanted to love this recipe.",

I put them on small baking sheets (covered with parchment paper) a dozen at a time and stuck them in the freezer. When the second baking sheet was full with another dozen, I pulled the first dozen out and put them in a 1 gallon zip-lock freezer bag and stuck them back into the freezer. When I'm ready to cook a few, I put them (still frozen) into hot oil and fry (be careful of the splattering grease...use a lid). They come out perfectly every time. Thank you so much for the only egg roll recipe I will ever use.",

It was so yummy looking, I couldn't wait to try it.  I added another 15 minutes to the cooking time suggested (30-35 minutes) and It was just right, but oven temperatures vary, so check on it during the last few minutes of cooking time.

Only problem...... now I've been begged to make them every weekend! They were so tasty and just the right size to snack on through the day. Super tasty and not hard to make at all (just a little messy). Only tip I can give is to line your bottom broiler pan with tinfoil as clean up was a little rough. Other than that, no complaints at all. Thanks for sharing this recipe and I'm off to make another batch for the SEC championship game in about fifteen minutes! GO GAMECOCKS!",

If you want creamier guacamole, use a potato masher rather than a fork. I would also add ground cumin and garlic (powdered is fine) and leave out the tomato--in Michoac&aacute;n, guacamole is very often served without it. &lt;br\/&gt;As for leaving the pit in to prevent browning, that does not work. The lime juice is what keeps the guacamole green, and most people make the mistake of adding too little lime juice or using avocados that are extensively bruised or already turning brown. Buy unripe, unbruised avocados up to a week in advance and let them ripen on the counter. Once they are ripe, refrigerate them to halt the ripening process.",

We also used it to spread on flat breads and even put a bit in the French Onion Soup. This recipe is GREAT! I use it for everything now.",

Tastes exactly like the Buffalo Wings we get there!  A note: I skip the shredded cheese.  I use shredded chicken breasts, 1 bottle Anchor Bar wing sauce, 2 pkg cream cheese, 1 bottle ranch salad dressing, and 1-1\/2 cups very good quality crumbled bleu cheese.  The Anchor Bar sauce and the bleu cheese crumbles are really what makes this dip.  I put all the ingredients into a crockpot and bring the crockpot with me when bringing this to potluck events.  Sometimes I will triple the amount of chicken and make \"chicken wing salad\" for sandwiches or wraps.  Super yum!",

My adaptations included roasting a whole red pepper and about 1\/2 head of garlic (in foil) at the same time I roasted the eggplant on the grill.  Finished off the eggplant in the oven as stated.  For those who think the garlic is too strong, try roasting it first.  Makes it sweet and mellow. I did go ahead and add 3 large cloves of raw garlic as well and it was a tad strong...bitey.  I may do less next time or just stick with the roasted garlic.  I did add a bit more tahini because I felt the mixture was kind of soupy. So..I know I added a few more calories but it's very good!  Serving with toasted pita wedges! Yum... I used the juice of 1 large lemon. Put the eggplant flesh, roasted pepper, parsley, garlic in bowl and hit it with the immersion blender til smooth...I would skip the olive oil next time...oily enough with tahini.",

I wish I would have used paper liners or a non-stick pan as mine did stick quite a bit.  I baked them at 375 for 28 minutes but would bake for 30 next time.\r\nI think there is huge potential to change out some ingredients depending on your mood.  For instance, I might try prosciutto instead of bacon and roasted red pepper instead of carrot and add Italian seasoning for an Italian style bite.  Perhaps I would use corn muffin mix instead of flour and add jack\/cheddar combo and green chilies for a little Tex\/Mex flair.  They would also be great with a little seafood and Old Bay.  The possibilities are endless.\r\nThanks for posting such a delicious and versatile recipe.",

I also cut very thin strips of roasted red pepper to ad little scarves.  Tip= allow cream cheese to become very soft before piping, it will be cleaner and easier but once filled, refridgerate filled olives prior to assemble to firm up cream cheese.  This will make assembly much easier. Pat roasted pepper strips dry w\/ paper towel for easier handling.",

        "description":"This dish is a regular served on the beaches of Mexico. Serve it as a seafood appetizer or as a side salad dish. You can alter it to suit your own taste. Make it as spicy or as mild as you wish. My friends all love it. I often use shrimp &amp; fish or shrimp &amp; scallops - when I do this I do not marinate the shrimp as the shrimp tend to get tough. I steam the shrimp and add them a few hours before serving as I mix all the ingredients together. In Mexico when they make this they often add sea water (not recommened).  If you are using frozen fish, choose a firm-fleshed fish and make sure it is fully thawed with as much moisture as possible removed.",

UPDATE: while a little time consuming to assemble, it is well worth it. Putting the cream cheese in the freezer for about 30 minutes helped it to keep its shape better as you sliced it. Also, I don't recommend substituting red wine vinegar for the white. It overpowered the other flavors a little bit. Everyone enjoyed it, and it was a lovely addition to our assortment of appetizers.",

They do require some skill to roll - unless you've made these before, you may want to have extra rice papers on hand in case you tear some! It is crucial to use only fresh herbs etc. in this dish, however you can use any cooked meat or fish combo that you prefer. Vegetarians may omit meat altogether. The prep time given is how long it should take - but first timers may find it takes longer to roll.",

This helps keep it from sticking and\/or tearing- If you need to prep these ahead of time or have left overs, you can store them in the fridge in an air tight container. Mine didn't get hard, but I also soaked the rice paper for 40 seconds each and they were not too soggy.The trick for storing them is not to let them touch, because they will stick together- Also wet enough paper towel (squeeze out excess water) to line the container beneath the rolls, and lay some across the tops. I had made a few too many but they were still just as good two days later and hubby even took some to work for lunch. I hope someone finds this helpful!",

Rinsed my 'canned' crab meat from costco. Used only 1\/2 of the old bay and NO salt. A smidge less on the worstershire and the tabasco. Dredged the cakes in flour and fried in a combo of butter and veggie oil. (I know fattening....but were they ever good!) This will be my GOTO recipe. Also made a crab cake remoulade sauce from another posting on this site to accompany them..... YUUUUMMMM. UPDATE: I make these ALL the time. Usually dredge in flour or more breadcrumbs and then fry in oil. This time - trying to watch calories, fried them in 1 tbl EVOO for 4 min a side, and the cakes got nice and browned. No need to add more calories or fry in lots of oil \/ butter. From now on - only going to fry them in 1 tbl total on non stick pan - heat at medium for 4 min\/side. P.S.S. Still make these ALL the time - I prepare them ahead - form them - and put into the fridge. Then pull them out - dust them with flour or bread crumbs and pan fry. I think the fridge and letting them 'set' helps to keep them a bit more together...",

This stuff is addictive... so addictive I am having a lock installed on my refrigerator (not to keep me out - but in case the neighbors find out!). I have picked at Pimento Cheese spreads at parties and potlucks but never have the desire to make my own... and then I was asked if I would make a batch for a friend...This is a cross between her mom's recipe and my creativity. Great on Celery Sticks, Crackers, Bread... even straight out of the bowl! Even picky four year olds liked it!",

I have also made these with only 1\/2 cup of melted butter (1 stick) and they are just as good but you need to spray the cookie sheet because they will stick.",

I noticed she would sometimes gag when she got a long piece of spinach so I experimented with the process a bit and I will never make them the old way again! Turned out so much easier and tastier! I used my food processor to cut the onion finely and then saut&eacute;ed it with 1\/4 c of the butter, saut&eacute;ed the spinach separately to evaporate even more moisture then added the remaining 1\/4 c butter, salt, pepper and garlic, cooked for 2 min on med heat. Put the spinach in a food processor. Mix onions and spinach well, mix in bread crumbs well, mix in cheese well, and then the eggs(make sure mixture is cool before adding eggs). The consistency was more like a nice dough so no refrigeration needed and held together so well I used a mini ice cream scoop to make the balls instead of rolling by hand. Took longer to saut&eacute; and process but I saved so much more time not refrigerating and not hand rolling!",

It makes a lot so I decreased it to 1 lb of meat and still have leftovers for another meal.  I used ketchup because I was out of BBQ sauce; the mustard was a little too tangy for me (I am not a big fan of mustard) so I added 1 Tbs of brown sugar to sweeten it up a little.  I will try with BBQ sauce and see if that offsets the mustard since it is sweeter than ketchup.  These little sloppy joes were great and got a thumbs up all around!  Made for Spring PAC 2013.",

Below is the original Life magazine ad from 1952 (image courtesy of Wikipedia). No Corn Chex, they were not introduced until 1958, nor pretzels and certainly no Cheerios, they are a General Mills product. In 1952 Chex was a Ralston Purina product. I love Chex Mix (home made, the store bought one is awful) I wish I could eat it all the time. Alas, time catches up with all of us and the salt and fat are no-no's now. Still, for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays I make up a batch or two and pig out. My secret pleasure, alright, one of my secret pleasures",

I always helped her grind the meat, and that I was the &quot;Big Cheese&quot; getting to do that part LOL...  Now I just use my blender, and it works like a charm, as long as you don't overload it.

Sandwiches come in many guises, from simple and elegant to hearty and robust; in my cookbook I aim to have them ALL in there! Sandwiches tick all the boxes for so many meals and events: the obvious high teatime table, cricket teas, picnics, packed lunches and quick snacks. These sandwiches are dainty and elegant and would be ideal for the teatime table. The use of fresh chives gives them a bit of a lift and you must try to use the salad cream as well as the mayonnaise; salad cream has a pronounced vinegary flavour which cuts through the richness of the mayonnaise and eggs.",

The mixture is still very gummy at that time and the nuts sink right into the cheese.  I let half the mixture set overnight and it was much easier to work with.  This makes a LARGE cheese ball.  I made two smaller ones.  I believe the sour cream keeps this at an excellent consistency for dipping and spreading.  It is not hard and difficult to spread as some cheese balls are.  Five stars for ease, taste and consistency.  Thanks Rucinda!",

I like a mix of romaines and iceberg...I marinate the roma tomatoes in olive oil (meyer lemon or orange blood), or orange zest, lemon zest and reg olive oil, sea salt or flavored salt and fresh pepper...toss the tomatoes at room temp and flip over 8-12 hours. I also marinate the cucumbers, slicing them on the mandoline side of a Microplane box grater. I cut the olives and the peppers in half, to make them go further for larger salad...its always well received...I wear gloves and assemble in large metal roasting pan, which can be tossed when finished.",

As far as I&#039;m concerned, they just &quot;hit and run&quot;.  This recipe was featured the other day and I saved it to try.  I have just now completed it and it is delicious!  The only change I made was to use a Mexican style blend cheese, because that&#039;s what I had.  It is not grainy, gritty or disgusting.  Remember, the  cheese you select to use will dictate the taste of the dish.  I have no burned flour taste.  I completely melted the butter, whisked in the flour, whisked in the milk and then kept whisking until it was thickened to my satisfaction.  I left it a bit runny, because the starch from the pasta will cause it to &quot;draw&quot; up.  Removed from the heat, stirred in the cheese until it was melted and creamy, then stirred in the elbows.  Pure mac and cheese heaven!  This is a classic recipe and not to be confused with a boxed mix or that made with Velveeta.  Velveeta isn&#039;t even classified as real cheese (and I still love it!).  Marie, thank you again for another wonderful recipe.  This is a keeper and I will use it often because it&#039;s such a fast meal.  To those of you who left rotten reviews, &quot;LEARN TO COOK&quot; before you post such nonsense.  Also, if a man leaves you because you flopped a dish--men are like streetcars--another one will come along shortly.",

With a sprinkle of parmesan, a french baguette and a red wine on the side this sauce creates the perfect evening!  I'm love this chef!!",

Instead of the cornmeal I usually use Panko which you can find in the oriental area of the grocery store. Use about 3\/4 cup of in place of 2 TBS cornmeal. There is no gritty texture with panko and the chicken ends up nice and crispy. Also, I have better results with the breading sticking better and frying crispier on the chicken with less buttermilk.

Add some butter to the cooking water, as well. Other seasonings should be added before you cook, as well, so it has time to get inside the rice.

There was none left, and I won't be afraid to make it again.  I'll confess, I used probably twice as much soy sauce, and added and extra dash of sesame oil - personal taste, and not heart-smart, but, hey, what can I say?",

Some women make them way to runny or rather they have too much liquid, while others make them dry.  Rather than expressing disappointment in the recipe the best thing would be for the person making this dish to look at their ingredients.  I followed the recipe to the letter and not problems.  I even added onions to the mashed potatoes.  Less eggs for watery mash ans more eggs for dry mash.  They fry up very nicely and DO NOT fall apart.  I stuffed mine with sausage.  Great recipe",

I have no idea what I'm doing, so I find recipes on Recipezaar with high ratings, scour the comments for hints and say a little prayer before any attempts in the kitchen. While these potatoes are delicious, I thought I would share what I learned in case there is anyone as desperately in need of help in the kitchen as me.\n\nFirst, I bought a mandolin specifically for this recipe, and I'm glad I did. Saved me A LOT of time. However, in putting half the potatoes in, I didn't separate them carefully enough... so in some cases, it was as though the slices were three times what they ought to have been.  DUH. Next time, I will take the time and care to lay the potatoes out in a single layer with a tiny bit of sauce alternating each layer to keep them from sticking together and not cooking thoroughly.\n\nNext, I made this recipe the day before because I've heard they taste better the second day. The first day, I tasted them and was worried that in putting the amount of salt called for in the recipe in that I had over-salted and ruined them.  But the next day, they weren't salty at all - they were perfect. (I cooked them the full hour; the next day, let them come to room temperature for an hour and then re-heated them at 350 for 30 minutes. Due to my not separating the slices enough, some of the potatoes were STILL not quite done.) But if I were to plan to eat them the same day, I would cut way down on the salt.\n\nHope no one needs as much help in the kitchen as me (if they do, they probably need another adult to watch them to ensure they don't end up killing themselves in a tragic vegetable-peeler-incident), but if so, hope this was helpful. Overall, this is an amazing recipe that even *I* couldn't ruin!",

        "description":"My kids will give up a steak dinner for this spaghetti. It is a recipe I have been perfecting for years and it is so good (if I may humbly say) that my kids are disappointed when they eat spaghetti anywhere else but home! In fact they tell me I should open a restaurant and serve only this spaghetti and garlic bread. In response to requests, I have posted the recipe for Recipe #28559 that uses approximately 1\/2 of the sauce from this \r\nrecipe. Have spaghetti one night and lasagna later!  Thanks to all of you who have tried my recipe and have written a review.  I read and appreciate every one of them!  Chef Note:  After I posted this recipe I remembered a funny incident--my dear husband usually has a nice bottle of wine handy so when I make a batch of spaghetti I just help myself to a splash of it. On one occasion, there wasn't a bottle opened, but there was a bottle sitting on the counter so I got out the corkscrew and helped myself. For some reason, the spaghetti that night was the best ever. My husband asked what wine I put in it and I showed him the bottle. He nearly fell off the chair. I had opened a rather expensive bottle he had bought to give his boss. Goes to show you--don't use a wine for cooking you wouldn't drink. You get the best results from a good wine!",

This does make a lot, enough to freeze for another meal. I did add double garlic and onions in it because we like them so much. P.S. Our daughter thinks the name (Jo Mama's World Famous Spaghetti) is cool too, and spaghetti is her favorite. Usually she asks if the sauce is Ragu or not, then she grabs the garlic powder. I don't that's gonna happen for supper tonight. Thanks for another great Keeper!  \r\nP.S. It didn't happen tonight, everyone loved it!",

My minor changes due to necessity: 1- used a mixture of white and red onion, because I was using up leftover raw onions from 2 other recipes. 2- used 85% lean turkey since I already had it, but would probably use the leaner variety the next time because this recipe was almost TOO moist. 3- used only 1 pound of turkey instead of 1.25 because that is how it is sold in our store.  4- used Panko breadcrumbs since they were ready and available. 5- I also found my meatloaf needed about 10 more minutes of cooking time to reach desired temperature.",

        "description":"Are you craving that great Mexican rice from your favorite taco stand? Here it is. This is just like a good Mexican restaurant rice. Many recipes taste good... but the texture just isn't right. You know how it is... you have prepared scores of Mexican rice recipes but always have been disappointed. It may be delicious but kinda &quot;gloopy and wet.&quot; Try this. Everything is pureed and cooked in. There are no chunks of anything... just dry fluffy rice with all the seasonings and just the tiniest hint of a tomato flavor. I will throw away all of my Mexican rice recipes- this is the one I have been looking for for years! \r\n\r\nI don't own a rice cooker but some people have had disappointing results using one. You will also need to adjust your cooking time if you want to use brown rice. I recommend following the cooking instructions as directed. Proceed at your own peril if you stray.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",

However, for those of you who would rather not rinse your rice and still have it come out fluffy and not sticky, I can tell you exactly how to do it.  It is the same way Dominican rice is cook.  Follow steps 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.  YOU DO NOT NEED TO PUT IT IN TH OVEN.  EVERYTHING IS COOKED ON THE STOVETOP. Allow all the water to boil out of the pot.  When you see air holes in the rice and a wooden spoon can stand on its own in the rice, then you reduce the heat to medium low and cover the dutch oven with a tight fitting.  Continue cooking the rice for 25 - 30 minutes.  DO NOT REMOVE THE LID DURING THIS TIME.  This method is great for cooking any type of rice dish and you only have.  When rice is cooked properly, the grains will actually split open down the middle and have a firm texture to them, and that is exactly what happens when you cook rice by this method.",

She phoned her mum,Toshiko, in Japan for this, as it's her favourite recipe, and I wanted to share it here. It's simple and so good, and Tomoko, who is only 16, did such a good job of cooking this, then translating the recipe to English for me.\r\n\r\n*The liquid will thicken to a glaze if you are patient. It just takes a bit of time. If you feel your chicken is cooked (and going to overcook) remove it before going on to reduce the liquid. Same thing, if you must use breast meat, remove it (so it doesn't dry out) and continue reducing the liquid . If you do it this way rather than thickening with cornstarch you will get a richer glaze and not need to add stock or broth instead of the water. It just takes patience. AND NOTE: A glaze is sticky and coats the meat, this is NOT a sauce.",

I doubled the ingredients and did 10 drumsticks BUT I threw it all into a crock pot. I didn't want to have to stand over the stove so the crock pot was great! I let it cook for 4 hours on low, and next time I would throw in some thighs and maybe even breasts. There was sooo much extra sauce, that it almost needed more chicken. My husband and kids loved it, the sauce is delicious even by itself over rice! The crock pot made the chicken so tender it was just falling off the bone. I eventually did take all the meat off the bone, put it over the rice and spooned the sauce over..YUMMY! Definitely a recipe that will stay with me forever, I even posted the recipe from this site onto my Facebook status as \"Tonights Dinner!\"",

Please read all the directions first--yes, they do take a long time to prepare, but only 30-40 minutes or less of that is active time &amp; they are truly worth it!",

My chicken breasts were so huge even Dolly Parton would have blushed. I had to pound them to thin them out so that they would cook evenly. My second problem was that I used such a large frying pan that I did not have a lid large enough to cover it. I ended up using foil as a lid but the wine and broth kept escaping as steam, so I ended up using a lot more than the recipe called for. I would suggest using a pan with a tight fitting lid so you will have more wine to drink. Both of the problems were no fault of the recipe and the flavor really was delicious!",

Try putting the fish or anything that you have dredged in flour\/breadcrumbs in the refrigerator for at least an hour before you go ahead and cook it.

These can be done with baby back or regular pork ribs. I have also made split chickens this way. The ribs are tender, moist and just slide off of the bone. I know that your family will love them just as much as my family does.\r\nI noticed that some are unable to find hickory smoked salt. You can use smoked paprika or just brush the ribs with liquid smoke before applying the rub. The smoke flavor is nice because it helps give the ribs a cooked-on-the-grill flavor.\r\nAlso, the easiest way to remove the membrane is to work a spoon, or I use the tips of my kitchen shears, into the bottom center of the membrane, work it back and forth to form a &quot;pocket,&quot; then I slide my thumbs in and work the membrane off from the center outward to the ends.",

For those trying to find the hickory smoked salt, the brand I use is \"Spice Islands\" they have it some of my local grocery stores, but it is available online too. I cook the ribs 2 hours in the foil packet as suggested, and I place the packet on a cookie sheet (in case of leaks. After two hours I remove them from the oven.  I then turn up the oven temp to 350 degrees. I open the foil and roll back the edges to expose the ribs, (watch out for the steam!) and tilt the pan and use a small measuring cup to remove the excess liquid. Then, I slather the meaty side of the ribs with sauce, and return them to oven for 30-45 mins. Just our preference, as the sauce doesn't burn or char and I don't have to watch them so closely. Fabulous ribs, and clean up is so easy!",

        "description":"A Lebanese friend showed me how to make this back in 1996. It's my mother-in-laws favourite salad and I normally make it on request specially for her.  I prefer flat leaf fresh parsley (also known as Italian Parsley) as it's better texture but curly leaf is alright. I normally buy the parsley and spring onions from the supper market prepacked bunches so if your measurements are slightly more or less it's alright, it doesn't have to be exact.  The bourghul also soaks a lot of the moisture and I like Tabbouli to be moist not dried that's why there is a lot of lemons and olive oil.  Like everything we cook it's all about the palate and who we are cooking for so if you choose to put less oil and lemons then it's ok.  Salt and black pepper to taste, so feel free to add less but not to much. The secret to good Tabbouli is that everything should be finely chopped.  Enjoy",

I dont use boiled water to soak burgul. I usually rinse my burgul and drain then add freshly squuezed lemon to burgul snd let it sit for it to absorb the lemon and become soft (this way your salad is not runny with juices). I would skip any pepper, snd I take the seeds out of my tomatoes.",

                "description":"FANTABULOUS!!!!  This dish was sooooo good I have to give a play-by-play.  I added 1 lb of halfed whole white button mushrooms.  For the sundried tomatoe I went to my freezer and grabbed a few of Mirj's \"Oven-dried tomatoes\" (which I have freezer bags full of) instead.    The only other thing that I used that was a first for me was the cajun seasoning.  Ironically, I had just purchased Pampered Chef's Cajun Seasoning.  I doubt this had anything to do with it, but I have never used a pre-mixed cajun seasoning before.  I layed a bed of pasta on a platter and poured the sauce over it all and served it \"family style.\"  We could have NEVER guessed what we were about to experience.  Honestly, with the exception of a straight-out alfredo, this is the best pasta sauce I have ever had.  The flavors just dance around in your mouth, not too overpowering, but they let you know they are there.  The entire meal my husband and I were scheming up different ways to make this recipe and we both agreed that we would like to try it with shrimp and also do just a veggie-version with lots of mushrooms, yellow\/red\/orange peppers, etc.  We are no food critics...but to us...this dish IS restaurant quality and is earning a spot in the front of the pasta section of my cookbook!!!  Thanks, Lorac, for this OUTSTANDING recipe!",

The added veggies add nutrician, enhance the flavor of the dish and they do not over-power.  The most time consuming step is dicing the potatoes, so I may use another suggestion of frozen diced hashbrowns potatoes next time.  Served with cornbread.  Simple, quick and yummy.

        "description":"Wow! This is even better than the BEST I have had in my fave Chinese restaurant. To make the meal go quickly prep everything the day or night before and store in the fridge. To make this easy to understand I have changed the terms to cornstarch slurry and sauce. The first is used to coat the chicken for frying, the second to coat the fried chicken. HTH I use a grater with small holes for the garlic or you can just zip all the sauce ingredients up in a blender or food processor. Enjoy! NOTE: I really appreciate all the reviews this recipe has received. I know that when making this it seems strange and like it just is not going to work. Trust that it will work even though the method and the way that the cornstarch slurry acts before cooking are so different. I was the same way the first time I made this. It does result in crispy pieces of chicken that are so like you find in a restaurant. The heat here is pretty much a balanced amount because some like it hot and some do not. Taste and add more heat as desired. Thanks again for trying this recipe. I hope that you have the great results that I have had time and again. Here is info, pics and heat levels of different chilies. http:\/\/www.foodsubs.com\/Chilefre.html",

In order to make this dish a little healthier, I skipped frying the chicken.  I just seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked in a small amount of olive oil until crispy.  Once the sauce was on it, I did not miss the fried part of it and you really could not tell a difference.<br\/><br\/>2.  Sauce:  I added fresh ginger and orange juice instead of water.  Both added another set of great flavors.<br\/><br\/>3.  I briefly steamed some fresh broccoli and red peppers and added them into the sauce with the chicken.  <br\/><br\/>I will definitley be making this again!<br\/><br\/>And to all the negative reviews, don't pay attention.  People need to use some of their own decision making in the kitchen instead of relying on a recipe to tell them EXACTLY what to do and EXACTLY how long to do something...when the chicken is crispy and cooked, it's done!  When the sauce is as thick as you'd like it, take it off the heat :)",

I had to double the recipe to make a big 9 X 13 pie to feed my gang, so I had alot of work ahead. I did all the prep work (minced the onion, peeled and diced the potatoes and carrots, and diced 1.5 lbs. of chicken breasts then cooked them in 2 cups of broth and a bay leaf) the day before then refrigerated it all until the next day, when once I made the top crust, it was a snap to do the rest. I just had to cook the already peeled and diced potatoes\/carrots, warm the chicken in the micro and make the sauce. Ohhhh so delicious!!",

                "description":"I have made this recipe hundreds of times...usually use self-rising flour, but I NEVER add any sugar, as I hate sweet tastes, and it always comes out wonderful, but has a definite beer taste.  I have added various herbs at times, and have also added various cheeses.  Cheddar (mild) is my fav.  You also do not have to \"pour butter\" on top, or even add it to the mix.  I don't add any oil, but I DO dot the top of the bread with pieces of butter.  I do not sift the flour and it comes out fine, but I just spoon the flour into a measuring cup.  The trick is, do NOT mix a lot, just lightly mix until you have pretty much coated all the flour in the bowl, but no more!  Overmixing will give you a hard loaf.  If you see a little bit of flour in the bowl, or when you put it in the pan, it is fine...do NOT overmix!  I just \"turn it\" into a buttered loaf pan, and then I take the spoon and  gently \"push\" the dough around to make sure it is evenly distributed, especially in the corners...do NOT make it completely level, or push down on it to spread evenly; just light pushing is all you need.  It will look lumpy on top...that's better.  Then just dot with butter, as much or as little as you want.  I also cook it at 350, not 375...you can even use 325 if your oven seems to bake on the hot side.  I usually cook it for an hour, but as soon as it is lightly browned on top, I take it out.  Sometimes, that is after 55 min., sometimes 1 hour...don't cook longer than an hour, unless you have it on 325 and it is not browned at all.  If it is lightly browned and when you push on the top with your finger it seems firm, take it out...1 hour should be sufficient.  I let it sit in the pan for just a minute, then I turn it out, and let the loaf lay on it's side on some paper towels.  You MUST let it cool, at least 20 minutes, or when you cut it, it will be a gummy mess!  It should be cool enough to where you can comfortably hold the loaf with your hand while cutting...if it is too hot to hold, then it is not cool enough.  I wait until it is slightly warm, and then cut it...when it is completely cooled, it is fine as well.  As I mentioned, it does taste more like \"beer\" if you add no sugar, but you do not need it, or any sweetner at all...it will still come out just fine...children would probably like it with some sweetner.  Good luck and enjoy!  I make it every weekend, as it is quick, and I always have the ingredients on hand....Also, DON'T USE EXPIRED Self-Rising flour, or EXPIRED baking powder!!!  I also use ROOM TEMPERATURE BEER, NOT REFRIGERATED!  Open the beer, and then pour it into the flour right away, and just stir until coated, NO MORE...DO NOT OVERWORK, VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!  Sifting the flour would probably help as well, but I don't...just remember, if you don't sift it, DO NOT PACK IT INTO THE MEASURING CUP!  Just spoon it in lightly.  Don't be afraid to experiment with different ingredients!  Have fun with it!",

The instructions were easy to follow and clear, and my biscuits were perfectly golden brown after the stated 10 minutes. My yield was exactly 24, and the entire plate was devoured by myself, my hubby, and our 2 dinner guests. (Biscuits are not all that common here in Canada and seem to be a real treat; my girlfriend's husband couldn't get enough and demanded my friend get the recipe.) My only variation was due to the fact that I was out of unsalted butter, so I used regular butter and cut back on the salt. While I do use buttermilk to bake with, I had never made biscuits with it; that's going to change from now on, as this recipe will become one of my standards.",

If you prefer your soup on the thicker side like chowder, use large potatoes or add a few more than what&#039;s called for. If the soup is too thick, add more stock. I like to cook up the bacon first then caramelize the onion in bacon grease before adding to the soup base in the crock. This recipe is easy to alter and make your own.

        "description":"Posting this per a request.  I've said it once and I'll say it again there is nothing Irish about Corned Beef and Cabbage, but Shepherd's Pie has always been and still is a staple of traditional Irish cooking.  This is a really easy, but tasty recipe that the whole family will enjoy.  It's nutritionally sound with all the major food groups represented.  The British use lamb in their Shepherd's Pie, but we've always used beef.  Do whatever you prefer or even try turkey if you're watching fat content.  This sauce is lovely and rich and should go well with any meat.  You can use fresh or leftover mashed potato.  I usually use 3 tbsp of ketchup instead of the 2tbsp of tomato paste as I like the hint of sweetness, but traditionally the paste would be more sound! You can also make individual pies which are always a hit with the kids.  This freezes beautifully too, so make two and save one! Just let it defrost and glaze with the egg and pop into the oven as directed.  Enjoy! :)",

I used all the ingredients mentioned in the recipe as well as followed all of the instructions.  The only thing that I did different, not on purpose, was use White Zinfandel wine, instead of red wine (I didn't have any red wine and didn't feel like driving down the mountain to get it when I had everything else cooking--lol).  Unless you like that kind of wine, don't use it.  When I buy more red wine, I will try it--so I could decided which one is best.  Also, it really makes a difference when you season your potatoes and get them into a semi-creamy texture with butter and canned milk.  Whip on HIGH with hand mixer.  Just a thought, if you haven't tried it that way.  : )",

If you put too much on you will taste the mayo and it will keep the coating from turning out properly; may even make it mushy.  In this case too much of a good thing is NOT a good thing.  This is a wonderful receipe.  I have managed to mess it up before by doing what I've listed above but you live and you learn.  ENJOY!",

I add whatever I'm going to add and thicken it all before putting in the dumplings, then it's all ready to spoon out when the dumplings are done. By the way, to make dumplings from a larger box of Bisquick, follow the recipe for biscuits but add a little more milk, enough so the dough is sticky, and drop them in the hot chicken mixture.",

As a former Olive Garden employee who has the taste of Zuppa Toscana burned in my tastebuds, I can truly say that my soup tonight came out as a PERFECT match.  I did customize this recipe with the help of previous readers, so I recommend following it like this...  I used 1 lb of hot Italian sausage, 3 medium to large potatoes UNPEELED, 1 small onion, 3 strips of thick sliced bacon, 4 cloves of garlic, 3 cups of kale (veins removed and sliced thin like ribbons), 32 oz of chicken broth, 2.5 cups of water, and 1 1\/4 cups of half and half.  I removed the casings from the sausage and browned the meat in a skillet, then putting aside in a stockpot.  Then in the same skillet, I cooked the bacon and onions side by side, and put the onions in the stockpot, and went to work chopping up the cooked bacon and also putting in the pot.  Then I sliced up all the potatoes... leave the skins on!... it creates awesome ribbons in the soup that add texture and flavor.  I sliced them lengthwise and then in half into 1\/4 inch thick triangles.  Then I put the chicken broth, minced garlic, and water and let boil for about 30 minutes, until the potatoes were tender.  Then I added the kale and half & half and let simmer another 15 minutes or so until the kale was tender as well.  Although the hot sausage left a reddish colored film on top of the soup, it properly seasoned the soup without needing crushed red pepper (which the real OG recipe includes).  Remember this soup should have a nice zing to it so I found that hot italian sausage worked beautifully.  What a fabulous soup for this chilly weather!!  Bon Appetit!",

In this recipe the ingredients are simple and won't kill you.:( All I had to buy extra was the apple juice. Also, I'm flabbergasted at the number of reviews!! This is a perfectly nice recipe, but 2,384 reviews??? Wow! I did not sub or change a thing. I did, however, mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl while the chicken pieces were frying: saves time. 1 - 2 tablsp olive oil, LinMarie, is by far not enough to pan-fry 2lbs chicken pieces!! I added maybe 2 or 3 extra tablespoons while the chicken was frying. Next time I will not use ground ginger, but rather 1 - 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger, which should be more flavoursome. The pepper flakes were fine (I think I used a full teaspoon). However ... the sauce needed thickening, and I did add cornflour mixed with a little water, right at the end. The sauce looked much more attractive once slightly thickened. I will make this again, because (let's face it) it's a lot of flavour with little effort. What I will change, is the breast meat. We don't as a rule like skinless breasts, and I think boneless thighs, skin on, or even bone-in thighs will be far more flavoursome. Sorry, I was not complaining, just explaining!!",

Since this is a layered recipe (you will be making two layers), the extra 1\/2 lb. worked great. I added a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies (undrained) into the cooked beef mixture and I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom. I made my own taco seasoning (recipe 25449 from this site is terrific). I always double the taco seasoning recipe even for just 1 lb. of ground beef but you can experiment and decide what is best for your family. I am convinced that when it comes to packaged taco seasonings, your recipe will only be as good as the brand of seasonings you choose because some of them are so strong (not heat) that the flavor is overpowering and that can be all you taste. This includes those layered taco dips too. I followed the recipe exactly regarding the remaining ingredients. I thought the ground beef mixture with the onions, seasoning and refried beans was too thick so I added some water to the skillet and stirred it around till it was the right consistency. Give this recipe a try, it is delicious. I served this with spanish rice, warm tortilla chips, sour cream etc... Enjoy!!     ",

The dish has turned out to be extremely popular but be advised that it's very spicy when the recipe proportions are adhered to. Unless you want a super-hot dish, I recommend cutting back on the ground red pepper in the marinade. It may also be a good idea to remove the seeds and veins from the jalape&ntilde;o chile in the sauce.",

I've made this recipe several times and found that instead of the marinading step, you can stir fry the chicken cubes in 2 tbsp of Tandoori Masala and it tastes just as good (if not better) and speeds up this recipe by quite a bit. Some other changes I've made to tweak it to my liking: I add small a white onion, one green pepper, 1tbsp of cayenne, and I substitute the 1 cup of whipping cream for 3\/4 cup of half and half and 1\/2 cup of plain yoghurt (still comes out very creamy). I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who craves a taste of India without having to go to a restaurant!",

        "description":"I originally found this taco casserole recipe in a Taste of Home magazine.  Since then, I have made this recipe at least 50 times.  I love it because the ingredients list isn't complicated and, based on the layers, I can readily remember all ingredients when I am at the store without my recipe card.  I have served this for myself and had wonderful leftovers or many times I have made it for company with a nice green salad to accompany it.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",

Other than that I did everything the same.  I put everything in the crock pot last night and just shredded the chicken this morning.  It is so SO good, we are having a hard time waiting to get into it before the football game today!  I will serve the sour cream separately.  Right now the soup tastes just perfect and I don't want to change anything!",

Even so, a suggestion that might be helpful.  The people that say it was flavorless...my guess is if you use a high quality sharp cheddar like Cabot instead of Kraft it will make it much more flavorful.  And then it seems like most of the people that really disliked this recipe said it was much too thick.   The recipe didn't specify whether or not to cover while simmering, but that can impact how thick the soup is as can the size\/shape of the pot and what your definition of a \"simmer\" and \"low heat\" are, among other things. Its easy enough to replace water that has evaporated or add more broth (depending on how the too thick soup tastes)...silly to grudgingly eat it or throw it out because its too thick!",

I used beer as suggested instead od wine, added 1 1\/2 tsp garlic and 1 1\/2 tsp hot chili flakes. I had company and everyone loved it . thanks for a keeper.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: This is the second time I have made this chicken easy and good!  It only takes about 15 minutes to put together, including sauting the mushrooms and onions.  I substituted Tomatoe Basil soup instead of the Tomatoe bisque. Again ,added some garlic skipped the basil, used beer instead of wine and added some chili flakes.  My company was coming for lunch so I prepared the sauce the night before put it in the fridge,and added the chicken in the AM, turned on to low at 6 AM and luch was served at 12:30. Served with plain steamed rice, Baby carrots & frozen peas, Nutty beans and fresh baked Danish for dessert.  There were no complaints.  Nice and easy luncheon after all the Christmas cooking, Thanks again Zaar",

Added about an extra tbsp curry powder. Added 2 tbsp cream from coconut milk plus a bit of the liquid. <br\/><br\/>Next time (tonight) I will skip the butter and add just the cream from the coconut milk. After finishing cooking, will take out the chicken and add yogurt to help thicken and add creaminess to the sauce (did it in a small bowl last time, tasted great just needed more curry). <br\/><br\/>Very quick and tasty meal. With rice and cauliflower for the sauce it is awesome. Left over cream and coconut milk can be added to rice while cooking.",

These are the changes I made; I toasted bread for breadcrumbs and then pulsed them in the FP along with a clove of garlic. I used 2 lbs of meat and 3 eggs, but kept the measurements of the other ingredients the same and included a few shakes of worcestershire sauce. To finish it off, I made a 50\/50 mixture of ketchup and bbq sauce. Baked for 1.5 hrs and let it rest for 15 mins. Came out perfect! I think the technique of soaking the breadcrumbs really makes this recipe stand out. Thanks for posting, I'll be using your recipe again.",

If you roll this out on a room temperature stone you won&#039;t get the stone up to temperature in the short time a pizza bakes. I think a stone, or in my case a cast iron pizza pan, in the oven for about 30 minutes while the oven heats is necessary to get a nice brown crust bottom. I roll my crust out on parchment and transfer the crust on it for a 6 minute bake. I then remove the crust, it will slide right off the parchment, load the crust and return the crust to the heavy cast iron, or a stone if that&#039;s what you&#039;re using. If you make a lot of pizza and don&#039;t have a peel, look into investing in one.",

I've been making Moxie's recipe for several years now and I'm proud to give it a home.  The only change I make is that I use two cans of cream of chicken soup and omit the can of cream of mushroom soup, because my kids dislike mushrooms.  This casserole is a church potluck staple here in Texas and there are as many versions of this dish as there are armadillos in Texas.  However, this is the best King Ranch Chicken recipe that I've found! This casserole also freezes well.",

Keeping in mind that I never measure anything, here's my take on it:  Instead of french onion soup, I use a dry packet of Knorr's onion soup mix.  I combine 1\/2 with the meat mixture (which otherwise is the same as this recipe) and reserve 1\/2 for the sauce.  For the sauce I use a tetra pak of beef broth to which I add onions, mushrooms, worchestershire & ketchup to taste, and the remaining onion soup mix.  To thicken I use a flour & oil rue.  Awesome over mashed potatoes!!!",

Even after taking half the onion out, I had too much onion. (This isn't the recipe's fault...onions are onions, they come in different sizes...mine must have been huge!) In the future, I will make some garlic butter, and baste the bun with it before putting the sausage on it.  I'll leave out more of the onion and omit the olives...I just didn't think the olives were right for the taste of the rest of the dish.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday tag!",

The lemon and garlic were in perfect balance, neither overpowering. The olive oil did not make it oily in the least. OK I did add a tad more fresh parsley than called for because I like it, and I get it free from my garden. I didn't bother with aluminum foil, just baked it in the same pyrex glass dish in which I marinaded it, tossing a sheet of foil over the top while it baked. A friend who shared it with me said it was the most flavorful salmon ever. I agree. \r\n\r\nI'm not an intuitive cook. In fact I'm a terrible cook. I can wreck delivered pizza. On the rare occasion I make something edible, good even, it has to be an easy recipe, and a good recipe. This recipe was not only easy, it was REAL easy. And it was not only good, it was REAL good.\r\n\r\nThe second time I made it I was overconfident and careless. I accidentally poured in too much olive oil, guessed at the measurements of other ingredients instead of measuring, used dried parsley in probably the wrong amount (it was raining. I didn't want to go outside to get fresh parsley), forgot the garlic until I was almost ready to cook it. My worst misake probably was marinading it too long - almost 4 hours. Even with these mistakes it wasn't too bad, kind of oily from too much olive oill, and kind of soft from the long marinade. So learn from my mistakes and do it right. It's worth it.  \r\n\r\nGood cooks suggest ways to improve a recipe. I suggested ways to make it worse. Measure once, cut twice. Wait...  This is my first review. I'll get the hang of it.     ",

Unless you like eating pure sugar, the brown sugar and molasses should be cut in half,the sweetness killed the sauce it was horrible. But the base of the sauce was good, and if cut in half is wonderful! I am an expierenced cook but found this very easy although I put the pork in the crock pot and cooked it and then added the sauce. But Donna thank you because when the sugar is cut in half it is WONDERFUL !! Thank you",

                "description":"Im giving this 5 stars because of the way I made it. I took my roast and stabbed it with a fork to put tiny holes in the top of the meat. Then instead of the Vegetable soup mix(not a good choice), I used the Lipton brand onion soup mix and rub it all over the top and bottom. So because of the fork holes in the meat, the mix goes more into the meat so when it starts to cook and really soaks that flavor into it!!!! So after bathing the meat in the mix, I wrap it up and place in fridge over night and it really lets that flavor sink in before going into the crock pot. So then next morning, I put in meat first then put my veggies around it and and put 1\/2 cup of water that I boiled 1 beef cube in from the microwave. I used less water because the roast will make plenty of juice on its own. (tip: why potatoes get mush so fast or your roast is more soupy... gross) Dont worry about adding soup mix to veggies, I only put it on the meat because the meat juices will season the veggies. (thats why I rub the seasoning deep into the meat.) Such a better taste too. I usually cook my roast on low for 8-9 hours because I do it while I am at work. By the time I get home its so tender and juicy and the meat falls apart on it own, I have never had an issue with the veggies being too soft or too hard. Oh!!!- And another huge tip: cook your roast upside down. Put the most fatty part on top because the fat is where the juice comes from so if its upside down then the juice cook down into the meat for the most flavor.",

The cod recipe I found right before this one had a ton of butter... which would have tasted great I'm sure, but would have defeated my intent to eat healthy!  I like how the crust stayed crispy.  I've made fish before only to have a gross, soggy crust.  The meal isn't going to be one of my all-time favorites, but I think that's just because this is simply meant to be a good, healthy weeknight meal.  (It could also be that the quality of my cod was only mediocre... I'm pretty inexperienced with seafood!)  Nothing fancy, just good solid nutrition and a great way to bake cod!  Thanks for posting.  It's a keeper for our cookbook!",

My mother, who was German and English, fixed our corned beef and cabbage exactly the same way when she used store bought corned beef.  However, the old English corned beef is soaked in brine.  You can use any kind of beef, such as chuck, sirloin, or fresh brisket, not an expensive cut.  Wash it in cold water, put in pot big enough so that it can be covered with cold water, add 1 box of un-iodized salt, cover, put in refrigerator for 3 days.  Turn a couple times during three days. (72 hrs. is sufficient, but, a few more or less won't matter.)  Meat will be grayish in color, but, this in no way affects the flavor. On cooking day, rinse off salt, put in pot and cover with fresh cold water.  Bring to boil, then, lower heat to a simmer.  No spices are added, just all the veggies incl. onions, taters, cabbage, turnip,and, maybe a parsnip or two, after the meat is fork tender. At this point, I remove the meat from pot, cover with foil, and put aside, then add the veggies. The only thing we ever drank with it was beer, and it's one of our very favorite dishes.  Just one comment.  I believe the person who wrote this meant \"gristle\", not grizzle.  Grizzle happens to be my daughter-in-law's maiden name.  We always had rye bread with it to soak up some of the pot liquor.  I've made myself hungry, so must go and get something to eat.",

Using cake flour is a must.  See Lennie's recipe #87689.  Be sure to properly measure your flour by lightly spooning into a measure cup until overflowing then using the backside of a knife to level off.  Too little flour will produce a callapsed cake and too much will have wet spots with dense layers.  Cake layers freezeable.\r\n\r\nPrep time also includes assembly time.",

Anyway - we all ate the bottom half with great joy! The layer cake part is very versatile and could be used in other layer cakes. I know that it will be my go to recipe from now on. The layer rise beautifully and taste wonderful. I will for sure be making this again!! Made for PRMR",

Use can of Peach pie filling instead of peaches in syrup. Both yellow and white cake powder work fine.

        "description":"This candy is named after a renowned Brazilian politician of the 1920's, Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes. He was an Air Force brigadier general who first gained notoriety for playing a part in quashing a communist coup in Rio. He later ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1946 and 1950, during a brief breeze of democracy which blew after WWII in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe name of the candy is that of his rank, Brigadeiro. Now, why would anyone name candy after an army general? \r\n\r\nWell, back in 1922, he was tall, dark-haired with blue eyes. AND SINGLE!!!\r\n\r\n The Brigadeiro campaign slogan was \u201cVote no Brigadeiro que &eacute; bonito e &eacute; solteiro\u201d.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOr the other version  \u201cBrigadeiro Brigadeiro, e melhor porque e solteiro\u201d.\r\n\r\nToday, brigadeiro candy is a must have in any birthday party and kids love them.",

MUCH better refrigerated, I wasn&#039;t a fan of frozen pudding because it had weird consistency.  Always a hit when I make this, although the nutritional facts are a bit disturbing.  I mixed one light cool whip into the regular cool whip and you couldn&#039;t even tell the difference.  To crush the oreos, I recommend a mini food processor, much easier than smashing with a hammer.  And if your cream cheese isn&#039;t quite softened, microwave it for 30 seconds - 1 minute and then put it into a Kitchenaid mixer with the confectionary sugar.  Try it!  You won&#039;t be disappointed!",

All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost. Hey, it is a PIE, it is SUPPOSED to be sweet.  Enjoy",

This pie is good served cold for Summer and warmed up for Winter.",

I wasn't sure what temp to put the oven on, it wasn't specified, so I put it at 375\u00ba, and that was a bit high, my baklava browned within 1\/2 hour.  So, I recommend 350\u00ba or maybe even 325\u00ba.  The flavor is a bit lemony, next time I would reduce the lemon juice to 3 tablespoons or even 2.  It was delicious though!

I poured this over the rhubarb and then melted a stick of butter and poured it over all.  Baked it, then ate it.  It is DELICIOUS!",

(Another version of this is posted as recipe #414696 but that one has some quantities misstated.) The homemade cookie crust makes it special. If you don't have 10&quot; pie pans, you can use 9&quot;, but the filling will be deeper, so it will need an extra 5-10 minutes cooking time. Prep time includes 1 hour for cooling the cookie.

                "description":"I'm a northern girl, who tries so hard to cook southern delights. This one does NOT disappoint. It was a HIT at this year's Thanksgiving feast. I followed the steps to the letter and it came out moist and delicious. Using regular sugar and flour are fine. Use REAL butter and REAL cream cheese. I did add 1 tsp of almond extract when I added the vanilla. I later read one of the reasons my cake probably came out so good is that I really beat the batter up during the cream stage and when I added the sugar. Easily plan 10 minutes if you are using a hand electric mixer, less if you have one of the big guns. Also, I read, when you beat in the eggs, don't beat too long, only 30 sec per egg - or your pound cake will get too airy. I ended up cooking it 15 min longer than stated. I wanted the inside cooked well. When you take it out, it still may seem jiggly, but as it cools, it firms nicely. Lastly, mix some powdered sugar with some lemon juice and make a nice glaze. Simply mix 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1 to 2 TB of lemon juice, stir till it gets thick and drizzle over the top. It will dry hard, don't worry!  Last hint, for us non-bakers..don't waste money on a cooling rack. Parchment paper on a cookie sheet does the trick. BE SURE TO POP THAT CAKE OUT AFTER 15 minutes LIKE THE INSTRUCTIONS SAID! I heard leaving it in the pan too long is a no-no. This was a lot of work, but you will WOW everyone with this recipe! Good luck!",

Our friend's DIL had made this the week before, to high praise.  After a REALLY big dinner, everyone said they couldn't possibly eat dessert.  We explained it was very light -- and ALL plates were scraped clean !  There are many steps, but instructions are clear, and it went together very well.  We were concerned about refrigerating without plastic wrap overnight, and decided to complete the recipe to the point of making the icing.  We covered the bare cake with plastic, then covered with frosting (using 3\/4 of recipe ), in the morning,and refrigerated til dinner time.  It held up well and sliced easily.  What a yummy finding !  Thanks so much for posting !!",

Making two is just as easy as one, and you can freeze one for that unexpected company.  Using a grahm crust is the traditional way. As Key Limes are rare in every part of the country except South Florida (Florida Native here, and I still haven't actually used one. So much for purity) you can buy Nelly and Joe's Key Lime juice which is excellent. The more you whip this, the thicker it will become, and I would strongly suggest you chill it overnight for serving purposes. Otherwise it will wilt and melt quickly.  This is the best recipe and No Eggs!",

We do make a few substitutions: sub whole wheat pastry flour, pare down the sugar to 1 1\/4 cups, decrease oil to 1\/2 cup & add 1\/2 cup applesauce, and add 1\/2 cup golden raisins.  We prefer to bake this in 2 round cake pans for 30-35 minutes, though it works well as sheetcake & cupcakes alike.  This recipe is fabulous as written & provides endless options for those who want to tweak it just so.  Thank you for getting me out of the bakery & into the kitchen for outstanding carrot cake!",

The gooey center is so good and I can't stop thinking of ways to make these fried cookies even more decadent! I want to put chocolate sauce on top or try to make them with jam in the center or try a cinammon\/sugar version...not they needed anything more, they just got my thoughts going! Thanks Bird & Buddha. In the picture I drizzled caramel sauce over the cookies. Made for PRMR 9\/08.",

Cherry tastes great with pineapple, and it's in the original dump cake but blueberry is great too! Tastes great hot or cold, by itself or with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream! Please use the polenta that comes in a tube, as this is how this recipe was tested. You can get it at any health food store like Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's has it at a really great price!!

I have altered the instructions after a few reviews that it was crumbly. This is not the recipes fault, it is inexperience. Proper candy making is about temperatures. 4 minutes of boiling (from the time the first small bubbles form) bring this candy up to proper fudge\/softball temperature as long as you are cooking over medium heat. When in doubt, use a thermometer.",

Get it to soft ball stage which is (I believe) 234 degrees. It will say soft ball stage on your thermometer. As for the sugar, it's been my experience that 2 cups is enough. I struggled with chocolate fudge. My recipe called for four cups of sugar. It was always grainy so one Christmas I took my pb fudge recipe and used a 12 oz. bag of semi sweet chocolate chips instead of pb. Turned out perfect. for chocolate I add walnuts and for pb I use crunchy pb. Hope my tips help :)",

This is a very sweet cake. I only put 3 1\/2 cups of powdered sugar. Next time I will only use three.  I did use a 9x13 and placed it on a cookie sheet. It took much longer to cook as I expected but wanted to try it.  I took it out when it was golden brown.  I would agree with letting it completely cool.  Enjoy!",

I must say that I've been intimidated with the thoughts of making a cheesecake in regards to whether or not to use a water bath & how long to cook it, but after some research I found that the reason why this recipe does not call for a water bath is because of the flour.  Cheesecakes with cornstarch or flour added to the batter do not crack as easily from overbaking. The starch molecules will actually get in between the egg proteins preventing them from over-coagulating. No over-coagulating, no cracks!!  So I did as the recipe stated & only put it in a pan therefore no cracks.  The only things I did differently was to not add the lemon because I had none & after it was done baking I left it in the oven to cool.  PERFECTION!!",

I've been making caramel rolls since I was a little girl, but had never followed an exact recipe for the caramel topping...just guesstimated, which led to inconsistant results from one pan to the next. The caramel topping was perfect in these, so I will be following this in the future. These would also be great with pecans, walnuts, black walnuts or butternuts added for those who like nuts. They didn't take all that long to make. I woke up earlier than the rest of my family, so I mixed them up and had them ready to go in the oven by the time everyone else got up. Sly Girl mentioned that they freeze well, but I didn't have any left over to freeze. Maybe next time, I'll double up on the recipe and freeze some for another time. I should mention that I don't have 3 8\" cake pans, so I used my 11 X 17 cake pan. I had to bake them an additional 15 or 20 minutes, which I expected. They were somewhat crowded, so next time I'll use 2 8 X 10 pans and likely have to take them out of the oven in a couple minutes less than the specified time. Thanks for sharing a really good recipe Sly Girl! We really enjoyed these.",

        "description":"PURE HEAVEN. That's all you really need to know. \r\n\r\nI suggest using a metal cookie scoop to form the truffles. I tried a melon baller, tablespoon, and plastic cookie scoop and they were all somewhat difficult to use. Coat your hands in the cocoa powder before hand rolling the truffles. \r\n\r\nI suggest making these at least a day before eating so that the wine flavor intensifies. Best consumed on day three for maximum wine flavor. You should be able to keep them for a week but they never last that long!",

The fudge filling directions tell you to 'add the butter' at the end. However, the fudge filling ingredient list has only chocolate and heavy cream - unless i'm wrong it appears the butter quantity is not listed here, only listed in the cake batter portion. It makes me suspect the whole recipe hasn't been tested. I won't make it. It's a very good idea to always have someone make your recipe, following the directions you intend to post on a recipe site, before you post it. It's so easy to omit some ingredient or a step, when you copy out a recipe. We've all done it. Proof baking is a good practice to use, but you must have someone else do it for it to work, because you already know what goes into the recipe and might not realize an item is not listed in the ingredients.",

OH MY GOODNESS!!! TO\r\nDIE FOR!\r\n\r\nWell that was that and never thought about them again, until this\r\npast week. My head has been screaming CANNOLI 24 hours a day. So,\r\nneedless to say i went to the grocery store today and they were in\r\nthe bakery for $3 each. I passed that by thinking i could make them\r\ncheaper. So I came to the zaar and chose this recipe.\r\n\r\nWell I spent part of the day making cannolis and decided instead of dinner to\r\nhave 2 of them. This put me on a sugar high for half the night, so I\r\nwent and laid down. Well I got up and did some things and I hear the\r\nscreaming from the refrigerator again!!! I open it and of course its\r\nthose damn cannolis again, yelling EAT ME! EAT ME!\r\n\r\nSo I grabbed 2 more and decided, I better hurry and freeze the rest\r\nand put them in my basement freezer where there is less of a chance\r\nof me hearing them making such a ruckus!\r\n\r\nSo I then sat down and ate them. I must be insane. I must have had\r\n800-1000 cannoli calories today! Whats a girl to do?\r\nI am afraid I may be in TROUBLE!! Is there a hotline for\r\ncannoli addiction? HELP!\r\nBy the way, this recipe was so great.  Thank you for sharing it with us!  Everything was perfect!  I did garnish the ends with extra chocolate chips and omitted the wine and cherries and they were so great!",

For the crust I split the flour and used 1\/2 cup of Quaker Oats and subbed in some brown sugar.  This might not have been so bad, but I forget to add the 1\/4 cup of flour to the sugar\/egg mixture.  The top was firmed up from baking but when I cut inside, it was a molten, sugary, fruity mess.  Sooo we're just calling it yumberry pudding, because it actually did taste great.  The Oats and brown sugar gave some nice texture, I used mixed berries that were nicely tart and the sugar goo amped up the sweetness.  My partner said, \"It's unlike anything I've every had before...\"  After we stopped laughing, everyone went in for seconds and agreed that it was still delicious.  Looking forward to trying it properly next time!",

Please use fresh lime if you cannot go ahead and try the already bottled lime juice but if you do think about that when you rate this recipe! I did both and there's nothing like fresh!

My family flew in last week for my DD's 3rd birthday but my mom sent a grocery gift card ahead & requested I add a bottle of merlot to the list.  At this point I remembered that I had seen a drink I wanted to try but was afraid to buy the merlot.  This was a win-win now!  Mom was game for trying the drink as well.  I had to get creative with the juices, as there were no plain mango or cran-mango available.  We ended up with two frozen concentrates: one orange-mango juice & one cranberry-pomegranate juice.  We used 3 Tablespoons of concentrate & 1\/2 cup water for each called for amount of juice.  We really enjoyed it.  The color was also really pretty.  Served over ice with the citrus garnish made for a nice presentation as well.  Thanks for sharing, Jane!  You've made me not afraid to buy merlot anymore! :) *Tink",

For one Margarita, exactly the same instructions for the lime and salt on the glass rims. Then, in a shaker, 2 oz. of Agave WHITE Tequila, 1 oz Fresh squeezed lime juice, 3\/4 oz. GRAND MARNIER, 1 tablespoon simple syrup, ice cubes (about 5 or 6) and shake approximately 9 to 10 shakes. Strain into limed and salted margarita glass. Place slice of fresh lime on rim and serve. Absolutely wonderful! NOTE: if you prefer your Margarita's on the sweeter side, add a BIT more simple syrup. Conversely, if less sweet is your preference, add LESS simple syrup. Simple syrup can be made adding 1 cup regular sugar to a lidded jar, then add 1 cup water to the jar. Place lid on jar and shake until sugar and water are totally combined. This can be kept in fridge for a week or two.",

What I like about this is that it's a real time-saver because it's made ahead of time. I will defiantly be entertaining with this again. I'm planning to make some wine glass tags, pack them up with this recipe and give them as favors to dinner guests. Thank you Susie!!",
